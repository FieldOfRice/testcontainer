# Testcontainers Redis Example

This repository shows a minimal working example of using
[Testcontainers for Python](https://testcontainers-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)  
to spin up a temporary **Redis** instance for integration tests.

By using Testcontainers, you don’t have to install Redis locally —  
it runs in a lightweight Docker container and is automatically cleaned up after tests.

## Features
- Runs Redis in a container automatically for tests
- No manual setup required
- Works with pytest
- Cleans up after runs

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Docker installed and running

## Installation
